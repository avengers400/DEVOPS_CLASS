DEVOPS:-


1. pipeline


1. git clone (source code)
2. building the code(.jar,  .war)(java- maven(pom.xml(dependencies), react or node js- npm(build tool), python- build tool(pip)) --- 3. sonarqube-sonar scanner()
4. building the image(building image through docker)--- ecr(send image to ecr)(aws inspector to scan the images)-- 5. another scanning tool (twistlock - twistcli)-twistlock console
6. container creation and deploying to  Kubernetes(vulnerability in container(twistlock defender--deploys as an agent)--for Kubernetes(deploys as daemonset)


k8s-cluster-nodes(servers)- pods- container

node1- (several pods)- each pod contains one container each(best practise)
node2 - several pods(

node1 - 1pod(container)
        1 more pod for monitoring
       

daemonset-- deploys desired no of pods in each node
