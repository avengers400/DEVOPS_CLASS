DEVOPS-
AWS ENGINEER(ARCHITECT)-
CLOUD SECURITY-



1.  WHAT IS THE FLOW OF YOUR OGRANIZATION:-, WHAT WORKS YOU ARE DOING, WHAT IS YOUR ROLE

ROLES:-

1. we are involved in architecture review part(security loopholes, architecture compliance , and the flow of the traffic is without any risk or not) 
2. INVOLVED IN APPLICATION DEPLOYMEMT(IN EKS(KUBERNETES CLUSTER), STANDALONE EC2(FOR LOWER ENVIRONMENTS OR FOR POC purpose)
3. we use to application deployment through Jenkins.
4. what type of application you use to deploy(we do both front and backend application based on requirement)

what are the components used in your architecture(

FOR DNS (we are using route53)--(DNSSEC, AWS WAF, AWS SHIELD)--------------> FOR LOAD BALANCING(USING ELASTIC LB,(NETWORK AND APPLICATION LB)-(WHAT FOR GATEWAY LB))------------> EKS cluster(group of ec2 servers(nodes)(pods)(containers))






route 53 ---------------------> A NAME MAPPING (URL TO IP), CNAME MAPPING(URL-URL)CITIBANK.COM

route 53 policies--- simple routing policy(Citibank.com------server ip), latency based routing(), geolocation(weightage based route(you can define geographical location(70% will go to india), failover routing(   citibabnk.com--------- 3 servers)(2 server down)



security- 
DNSEC SIGNING(DNS POISONING-- DNS SHOULD BE SIGNED)
SQL INJECTION, XSS SCRIPTING---- AWS WAF(PROTECT AGAINST COMMON EXPLOITS) --- WAF ACL---RULES--
AWS SHIELD(DDOS ATTACK PROTECT))(STANDARD AND ADVANCED)
INGRESS- (NGINX, HA PROXY, LB)

LOAD BALANCER:-

1. load balancer-- listener group(listens the port you defined in load balancer (80, 8080, 443(secured))--> target groups(ec2 servers)
In case of EKS:-
load balancer-- listener group(listens the port you defined in load balancer (80, 8080, 443(secured))--> ingress(its a load balancer)---> EKS
WHAT TYPE OF LOADBALANCING(WEB BASED APPLICATION- ALB(APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER)
WHAT FOR GATEWAY BALANCER------>INTRUSION DETECTION(MONITORS THE TRAFFIC GOING TO FIREWALL(LIKE SECURITY GROUPS OR NACLs)--
NACLs(network access control lists)--- 100--DENY(10.0.0.0), 101(ALLOW)(10.0.0.1), 102--IT WILL FOLLOW INCREASING ORDER RULES
