s3-- versioning, lifecycle policy, encryption(concenterate on these 3)
cross account role

s3-- object storage is like a google drive
s3 Access point
s3 cross region replication--- async---high availability--accidental damage--suppose one delete s3 buckey..your data will,be dafe in another s3 bucket


you dont want to store objects for a long time-- we have to enable s3 lifecycle policy---standard--30 days-infrequent ia-90 days--glacier


files should not override when same name file is uploaded in s3---- s3 versioning( test.txt   text.txt-1)

s3 access points--- different application  wants to access same data in s3

you can have different https endpoint and distribute to application team

s3 encryption---> ss3-s3(default), s3-kms(create your aws key and encrypt the data..you have control over it to delete and store but not pover the key material), customer provided key(you have control over the key material))
