s3-- object storage is like a google drive
s3 Access point
s3 cross region replication--- async---high availability--accidental damage--suppose one delete s3 buckey..your data will,be dafe in another s3 bucket


you dont want to store objects for a long time-- we have to enable s3 lifecycle policy---standard--30 days-infrequent ia-90 days--glacier


files should not override when same name file is uploaded in s3---- s3 versioning( test.txt   text.txt-1)

s3 access points--- different application  wants to access same data in s3

you can have different https endpoint and distribute to application team
